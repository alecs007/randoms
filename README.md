**randoms.fun** is a simple and easy-to-use website where you can generate random numbers. Whether you need it for a game, making decisions, or just for fun, this tool does the job quickly and reliably. It has a clean design and works well on all devices, so anyone can use it without any trouble.

**What I learned while making randoms.fun:**

    â€¢ JavaScript Logic: Developed a deeper understanding of working with JavaScript functions to create dynamic and interactive number-generation logic.
    â€¢ UI/UX Design: Improved skills in crafting a clean and intuitive interface for users.
    â€¢ Domain Integration: Gained experience in linking a custom domain (randoms.fun) to a hosted project.
    â€¢ Hosting: Explored deployment options and successfully published the project online, ensuring it loads quickly and reliably for visitors.

Overallf, building this project was a great experience that helped me grow as a developer. I gained confidence in turning an idea into a finished website and learned skills that Iâ€™ll use in future projects.
